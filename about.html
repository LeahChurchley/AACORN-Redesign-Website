	<p>AACORN's intent is to develop and promote the field of organizational aesthetics (broadly defined). We wish to provide a wide range of forums where researchers interested in connecting art, aesthetics, and creative practice within organizational and work settings can meet, exchange ideas, share resources, and experiment with new forms of thinking and practice. These forums include things like websites, conferences, joint publications, and joint action events.</p>

	<p>Membership in AACORN requires being nominated by an existing member and having that nomination accepted by the Membership Group. We find that this helps keep the network a safe and friendly place.</p>

	<p>The AACORN website exists with the support of the Learning Lab Denmark. It was originally designed by John Churchley and <a href="https://rosschurchley.com"> Ross Churchley </a> in 2014. It was re-designed in 2016 by Ross and is currently maintained by John Churchley and <a href="http://leahchurchley.com"> Leah Churchley. </a></p>
